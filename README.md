Software drivers for the mbed platform

ARM mbed is a solution to quickly prototype and build embedded applications using ARM microcontrollers. The goal of these projects (microcontroller/mbed) is to be able to provide reference projects for the mbed platform, to help customers use ADI parts with their mbed projects.

These examples can be run using the online compiler at https://developer.mbed.org or by setting up your computer using the following guide: https://wiki.analog.com/resources/tools-software/mbed-user-guide
